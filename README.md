# NOTES POST-ASSESSMENT
I've added the following based on the recommended guide above
- Drop any event where u is < lastUpdateId in the snapshot.
- The first processed event should have U <= ``lastUpdateId AND u >= ``lastUpdateId
- While listening to the stream, each new event's pu should be equal to the previous event's u, otherwise initialize the process from step 3.ß
- If the quantity is 0, remove the price level.
